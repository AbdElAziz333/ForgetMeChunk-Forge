ForgetMeChunk (Forge) is a simple client side performance mod for Minecraft that prevents light map unloads on the client, this eliminates the fps drops caused by crossing certain chunk borders.
However this casues a memory leak, this memory leak is reset by changing dimension or leaving the server/world and i will fix this issue soon.


### Support the Original Creator
ForgetMeChunk (Forge) is impossible without the high-quality contributions made by the original ForgetMeChunk developer, and as such, i would like to ask you support him.


### Issues and Feature Requests
If you'd like to get help with the mod, feel free to open an issue here on GitHub, and if you want to propose new features or otherwise contribute to the mod, i will gladly accept pull requests, as well!
