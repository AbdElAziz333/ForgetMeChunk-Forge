ForgetMeChunk (Forge) is a simple client side performance mod for Minecraft that prevents light map unloads on the client, this eliminates the fps drops caused by crossing certain chunk borders.
However this casues a memory leak, this memory leak is reset by changing dimension or leaving the server/world and i will fix this issue soon.
